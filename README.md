# Date-Analysis-Terrorism-Around-the-Globe

This is my Data Analysis course final project in my B.Sc at TAU.

In this project, I used a dataset of terrorism attacks around the globe in order to learn a little bit about where terrorism hits and when, and to understand more when it is more dangerous.
